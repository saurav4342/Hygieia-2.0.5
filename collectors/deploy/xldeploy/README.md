# Hygieia Deploy Collectors / XLDeploy (Community Contribution)

This project uses Spring Boot to package the collector as an executable JAR with dependencies. Code created against XL Deploy 5.1.4.

## Building and Deploying

To package the collector into an executable JAR file, run:
```
mvn install
```

Copy this file to your server and launch it using :
```
java -jar xldeploy-collector.jar
```

## application.properties

You will need to provide an **application.properties** file that contains information about how to connect to the Dashboard MongoDB database instance, as well as properties the XLDeploy collector requires. See the Spring Boot [documentation](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-external-config-application-property-files) for information about sourcing this properties file.
