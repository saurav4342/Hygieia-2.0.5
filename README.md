### What is Hygieia℠

##### Pronunciation:      hi-gee-ya (origin Greek)
Hygieia℠ is a single, configurable, easy to use dashboard to visualize near real-time status of the entire delivery pipeline.

Please view a video below to see Hygieia℠ in action

We use tools for everything today and each tool has its own unique dashboard to present information. What is lacking is a near real time consolidated view of the end-to-end delivery pipeline.  This view and a continuous feedback loop are critical to the success of
any DevOps organization.

Capital One Engineers from our DevOps team developed Hygieia keeping in mind the need for such a tool since none is available commercially out of the box in ready to use the state as well as ease of use.
For the past two years, we’ve looked for DevOps visualization tools in the commercial market as well as in the Open Source community


* There are some excellent commercial ALM tools that allow one to visualize traceability between stories, code, tests and builds, however, they do not cross over from build to deployment</li>

* There are some good commercial Operations tools that provide visibility into server and application run time health, metrics, analytics etc. however they do not provide visibility into the development and build activities</li>

* Open source tools/frameworks such as Grafana provide generic framework to build a dashboard, however, collecting data from the numerous DevOps tools is still the challenge.</li>
